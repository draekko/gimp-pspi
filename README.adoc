== Introduction

This is pspi, a GIMP plug-in that interfaces to Photoshop filter plug-ins.

NOTE: First, the bad news: Pspi only works on systems that understand i386 Windows executables, more specifically, DLLs. (Photoshop plug-ins are actually DLLs.) Pspi was developed on (i386) Windows. It is also possible to build and use it on i386 Linux, using Wine.

* To build pspi, you will need the headers from the Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.5 SDK which is available https://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshop/sdk/eula.html/[here].

* To build pspi on Linux, from a terminal configure it like this:
//Here I need to put some pretty formatting
export CC=winegcc
export CXX=wineg++
./configure --with-pssdk=/path/to/pluginsdk

* Before compiling on Linux, you need to fix a few glitches in the SDK headers. Copy the adobe patch to /path/to/pluginsdk and do :
//Here I need to put some pretty formatting
patch -p0 < adobe_photoshop_cc_sdk.diff


== Debugging pspi

* You can set the environment variable PSPI_DEBUG to have pspi print out various debugging messages at run-time, for instance (in a Windows command prompt):
//Here I need to put some pretty formatting
set PSPI_DEBUG=resource_suite:debugger

* Or in a Linux shell:
//Here I need to put some pretty formatting
export PSPI_DEBUG=ALL

* See the source code for other possible values. Obviously, this environment variable must be set before starting the GIMP (which eventually runs pspi).

* On Windows, as pspi is a Windows GUI application, to actually see the debugging print-out, you have to start GIMP from a command line with stdout going somewhere, for instance:
//Here I need to put some pretty formatting
	gimp --verbose | cat

** This stdout redirection will be inherited by GIMP's children, like pspi.

== Run-time setup

* Pspi has a search path consisting of folders where to search for Photoshop filter plug-ins, which are files with the extension .8BF. These folders are searched recursively.

* Pspi stores info about the Photoshop plug-ins found in the pspirc file in the user's personal GIMP directory.
** The first time a .8BF file is noticed, pspi loads it and searches for the so-called "PIPL"resources, which contain some more information about the Photoshop
plug-in.
*** For instance where it should be located in Photoshop's Filter menu. It gets a identical menu entry in GIMP's <Image>/Filter menu.

* Unless the .8BF file changes, it isn't loaded on subsequent GIMP starts, but only when the filter is invoked.

* Also files with the extensions .EFF and .DLL are checked to see if they are Photoshop plug-ins.

== Reverse engineering
 
The hardest thing in writing this plug-in was figuring out the stuff in the Photoshop plug-in communication that isn't clearly documented. 

* To make the reverse engineering easier, I wrote a "proxy" Photoshop plug-in, piproxy. 
** The Windows resources of a real Photoshop plug-in (the "target") is copied to piproxy.8bf.
** The target should be moved away so that Photoshop won't find it, and instead piproxy.8bfshould be put where Photoshop will find it.
**Thus, piproxy gets loaded when the menu entry for the original plug-in is invoked. 
*** It then loads the original target plug-in, and starts passing calls back and forth between Photoshop and the target, while
logging the stuff that passes through. This works fine.
**** If you intend to run piproxy, set the PIPROXY_LOG and PIPROXY_TARGET environment variables. See the source code.

** The piproxy sources are included, but it does not get built by default.

=== Personal discovery while developing pspi
* After a week of late-evening hacking, the breakthrough came when I realized that the "Handle" type in the Photoshop API is used by some plug-ins in an undocumented way. 
** Instead of treating a Handle as an opaque type, they "know" that a Handle in fact is a pointer to a pointer, and use it like that without calling the "lock" API which is the documented way to get the pointer from a Handle.
